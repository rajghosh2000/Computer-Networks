# Problem Statement

Install wireshark/tshark in the mininet VM? Create a binary tree topology with 7 switches in mininet. Capture packets at the root switch. Write a C program to extract the headers and draw a time diagram to show the protocols displayed in the captured file (save the .pcap/.pcapng file of wireshark/tshark) during a PING operation. List the L2, L3, L4 header fields that can be extracted from the .pcap/.pcapng file.
