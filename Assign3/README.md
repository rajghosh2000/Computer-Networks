# Problem Statement

Create an online chat-bot using udp socket. Chat-bot server will respond to client's messages with minimum delay. Measure the delay in milliseconds between a client's request and response. Also display conversation in client side with time-stamp (should be calculated at server only) of both the sides and response time after every response (response time should be calculated at the client only). Multiple clients should chat simultaneously with bot server. Run chat client and server programs in mininet hosts. Each entity will use individual IP. (Appreciations will be given to them using AI algorithms at the chat-bot. However, no extra marks for using AI. It is optional)

**** NO AI ALGO USED IN THE SOLUTION ****
