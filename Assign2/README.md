# Problem Statement

Write a C program which generates ICMP echo request messages towards a target IP (taken as user input) by manipulating the source IP address (taken as user input). Use a control loop or function to determine the number of packets to be generated (taken as user input). Use ip.h, ip-icmp.h and necessary other system libraries including socket.
